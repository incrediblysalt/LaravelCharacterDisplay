<p style = "margin-top: -2px;"> <span style="font-size: 25px;">&ensp;T</span>he Strix are known for their giant, elegant wings, and for their mechanical ingenuity. While Ashkii is a prolific mechanic, it's no secret that she's missing the same iconic wings as other Strix. Although noticeable, she's never mentioned to any of her companions as to why her wings are missing.</p>
<p style = "margin-top: -5px;"> &ensp;She has reasons to keep it secret, however, as she attempts to escape her past. Fleeing from her family and her enemies alike, Ashkii's found herself with the Starfinders, and joined up with her party to find the mysterious Starstone fragment. Though many, many others are striving for it as well.</p>
<p style = "margin-top: -5px;"> &ensp;Ashkii would never admit she does enjoy working with both the party and the Starfinders, but as ominous threats from her past keep arising, she's found herself put between a rock and a hard place, with nowhere left to run.</p>
